Use cases
----------

VisualQC supports the following use cases:

**Structural MRI**:

 - Checking the accuracy of white and pial surfaces (from Freesurfer and other algorithms)
 - Evaluate the accuracy of skull-stripping (e.g. from Freesurfer or BET or 3dSkullStrip or SPM)
 - Assess the accuracy of tissue segmentation (gray matter, white matter or CSF masks)
 - Inspect the quality of raw T1 MRI scan (for motion, ringing, ghosting, or other artefacts)

**Other modalities to be supported soon.**
